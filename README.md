 # Installation

Before you start, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from here. Please ensure that you download the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js.

To check if you have Node.js installed, run this command in your terminal:

   node -v

If Node.js is correctly installed, you should see a version number. If the version number is 14 or above, you're good to go. There's no need to install Node.js again.
